scheduler
=========

Scheduler is a small employee scheduler built in 24 hours! I implemented the concept in a coding competition ([CodeDay Seattle](http://codeday.org/)). Afterwords, I spent some time building a user-interface with raphael.js. It features recursive backtracing to generate schedules. Each click of next above generates the next solution. In the future, I would like to generate a sample of all solutions and sort accordingly. 

Download the source, open the index file in a browser and click next to see a generated schedule.

Note* Employee availability data is currently hardcoded into the application in the js/src/Employees.json file.
